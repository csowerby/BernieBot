 TODO: -
 

 
 Next:
    
 
 * Implement make/unmake move
    * Use XOR to update bitboards https://www.chessprogramming.org/General_Setwise_Operations#UpdateByMove
    * Check Legality of Move immediately after making move
    * Must not be in check immediately after move is made
        * if in check after all PL moves, then you're in mate... darn.
 
 
 * Implement function to check legality of PL moves?
    -> this is makeMove then check if in check, if not, we good. 
    
 
 
 * Implement minimax
 * implement ab pruning
 * Implement different moveGen that separates quiet moves and attacks?
 
 * Conider writing pop_ls1b funcntion using better bit-twiddling to reset bit (might save an instruction)

  * Zobrist hashing not super important -> implement for transposition table.
  * Move history? Is this necessary? 
 
 
 * for performance - switch any function passing less than 8 bytes to passing the actual object rather than a pointer
 
 * Consider in the future using a bitboard for attacked squares - legal move generation instead of PL 
 
 * better to just be passed a bitboard with target Square and origin Squre & 4 digit code?
 
 * PRETTY SURE IT IS FASTER TO DO PIECE CENTRIC MOVE GENERATION BECAUSE OF SUPER FAST BITBOARD OPERATIONS i.e. encode moves with originPiece, targetSquare? also to move gen function pass just bitboards of each knight/king/sliding/diag piece moves, then use bitwise ops to isolate ls1b bitboard, and apply xor to the bitboards, might not even need
